When I'm not hiding in the library, you can usually find me skulking about on GitHub. 

**What I do:**

What do I do on GitHub? I would say it's 90% making empty commits and 10% actually doing something.

**What I do for fun:**

You're looking at it. Also complaining. The years of League of Legends have destroyed my ability to say anything positive. 

**Favourite Coding Language:**

While I don't have a go to language, I certainly have some favourites. Usually, the lower, the better. 
I'm a big fan of C and C++ since it actually feels like you're doing something when you use them. ASSEMBLY
is also fun when I'm feeling masochistic.

**Least Favourite Coding Language:**

Anything relating to web development is affectionately known as "The Devil's Programming". Why would you program 
something to be functional when you can program it to be oh so pretty. 

**Favourite Quote:**

"Get Low" - Lil Jon
