When I'm not posting about how much I love billionaires on LinkedIn, you can usually find me skulking about on GitHub. 

**What I do:**

What do I do on GitHub? I would say it's 90% making empty commits and 10% actually doing something. I treat 
coding languages like I treat my girlfriends. I have commitment issues. That is to say, I don't have a specialty. 
If you were looking for someone who exclusively codes in JavaScript, I'm not your guy. 

**What I do for fun:**

You're looking at it. Also complaining. The years of League of Legends have destroyed my ability to say anything positive. 

**Favourite Coding Language:**

While I don't have a go to language, I certainly have some favourites. Usually the lower the better. 
I'm a big fan of C and C++ since it actually feels like you're doing something when you use them. ASSEMBLY
is fun in short bursts, but I can't say I have the mental capacity to code in it consistently. 

**Least Favourite Coding Language:**

Anything relating to web development is affectionatly known as "The Devil's Programming". Why would you program 
something to be functional when you can program it to be oh so pretty. 

**Favourite Quote:**

"Get Low" - Lil Jon
